#+TITLE: Find-char

A taste of the =f= operator of vim in Emacs.

* Usage
- Bind =find-char= to some key, say =M-j=.
- Hit =M-j= and the character that you want to move to. You can combine numerical arguments with =find-char=, e.g., =C-3 find-char=, =C-- C-4 find-char=.
- Press “ ’ ” or the character to move forward, =;= to move back.
- Press the character you are searching for to move forward, Press the capital of it to move backward. E.g, =M-j f=, =f= forward, =F= backward.
- Press any other key to finish

*Important:* find-char doesn’t search the whole buffer since it’s just for short distance jumping.

* Convenient commands
| key   | Command                         |
| =C-d= | Quick delete region (like =df=) |
| =C-w= | Quick copy region               |
| =C-v= | Toggle highlight of region      |

The mark is set to where you began jumping, and you can do whatever you want with that.

* Customization

| Variable                 | Description                                                                |
| =find-char-search-range= | find-char doesn’t search the whole buffer, but only a portion around point |
| =find-char-stop-at=      | where does find-char stop, can be ='beginning= or ='end=                   |

You can customize =find-char-transient-map=, the map that activates during jumping. Default value is:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar find-char-transient-map (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
                                  (define-key map (kbd "'") #'find-char-forward)
                                  (define-key map (kbd ";") #'find-char-backward)
                                  (define-key map (kbd "C-'") #'find-char-forward)
                                  (define-key map (kbd "C-;") #'find-char-backward)
                                  (define-key map (kbd "C-d") #'find-char-quick-delete)
                                  (define-key map (kbd "C-v") #'find-char-toggle-region-highlight)
                                  (define-key map (kbd "C-w") #'find-char-copy-region)
                                  map)
  "Transient map for find-char.")
#+END_SRC

* Comparison with [[https://github.com/lewang/jump-char][jump-char]]

I’ve been using jump-char for quite a while and it is great. Here is the differences between jump-char and find-char:
- jump-char uses isearch, which brings advantages and disadvantages. It is more like searching than a jumping. E.g., there is no trivial way to jump with region activated AFAIK .
- jump-char integrates ace-jump while find-char doesn’t.
