#+TITLE: Find-char

A taste of the =f= operator of vim in Emacs.

* Usage
- Bind =find-char= to some key, say =C-'=.
- Hit =C-'= and the character that you want to move to.
- Press ='= or the character to move forward, =;= to move back.
- Press any other key to finish

* Convenient commands
| key   | Command                         |
| =C-d= | Quick delete region (like =df=) |
| =C-w= | Quick copy region               |
| =C-v= | Toggle highlight of region      |

* Customization

| Variable                 | Description                                                                |
| =find-char-search-range= | find-char doesn’t search the whole buffer, but only a portion around point |
| =find-char-stop-at=      | where does find-char stop, can be ='beginning= or ='end=                   |

* Comparison with [[https://github.com/lewang/jump-char][jump-char]]

I’ve been using jump-char for quite a while and it is great. Here is the differences between jump-char and find-char:
- jump-char uses isearch, which brings advantages and disadvantages. It is more like searching than a jumping. E.g., there is no trivial way to jump with region activated AFAIK .
- jump-char integrates ace-jump while find-char doesn’t.
